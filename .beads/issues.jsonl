{"id":"acs-0001","title":"Electron installer for ACS distribution","description":"Set up an Electron app that serves as both the installer and GUI for the ACS system.\n\n## Requirements\n- Electron app bundles the ACS binary and installs it on the user's system\n- The bundled frontend reads the ACS daemon's port info and connects to it\n- Provides a GUI to manage the ACS system (view/create/edit/delete jobs, view logs, etc.)\n- Installer handles first-time setup (installing the acs binary, setting up the daemon service)\n- The Electron shell wraps the existing Next.js frontend, pointing it at the local ACS daemon\n\n## Key Decisions\n- How to detect/read the daemon's port (config file, default port, discovery)\n- Installer flow: install binary, start daemon, launch GUI\n- Platform targets: Windows first, then macOS/Linux\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- User can download and run the Electron installer\n- ACS binary is installed and daemon starts\n- GUI connects to the running daemon and provides full management capabilities","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-09T00:00:00-08:00","updated_at":"2026-02-09T00:00:00-08:00"}
{"id":"acs-6nk","title":"BUG: ScriptFile trigger args broken on Unix - passed as single filename arg","description":"In executor.rs build_command(), ScriptFile with trigger args does cb.arg(\u0026effective_script) where effective_script is 'deploy.sh --env staging'. On Unix this passes the entire concatenated string as a single argument to /bin/sh (without -c), so sh tries to open a file literally named 'deploy.sh --env staging'. Fix: For ScriptFile on Unix, use /bin/sh -c 'script args' or pass args separately. Need to write a test that validates the bug first, then fix. When fixed, update job-management.md ScriptFile trigger args section.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"34466548+Jtonna@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T08:18:31.2242196-08:00","created_by":"Jacob Tonna","updated_at":"2026-02-11T08:27:37.1943842-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T08:27:37.1943842-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed: ScriptFile on Unix now uses /bin/sh -c when trigger args present.
